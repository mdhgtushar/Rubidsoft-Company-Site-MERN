## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Local Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
4. Set up environment variables
5. Start development servers
6. Run tests to ensure everything works

### Environment Configuration
- Copy example environment files
- Configure database connections
- Set up API keys and secrets
- Configure development settings

## 📝 Code Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### JavaScript/Node.js Standards
- Use ES6+ features when appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Prefer const and let over var
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### React Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow component naming conventions
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use meaningful component names
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Database Standards
- Use meaningful collection and field names
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Follow MongoDB best practices

- Implement proper data validation

## 🔄 Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - For urgent fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - For documentation changes

### Commit Message Format
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh functionality
fix(api): resolve user profile update validation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Management
1. Always create feature branches from main
2. Keep branches focused on single features
3. Regularly sync with main branch
4. Delete branches after merge

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Requirements
