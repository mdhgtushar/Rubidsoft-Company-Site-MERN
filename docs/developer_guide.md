## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
The Rubidsoft Company Site follows a modern three-tier architecture:

**Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
- React.js single-page application
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Client-side routing and state management
- Role-based user interface

**Application Layer (Backend)**
- Express.js REST API
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

**Data Layer (Database)**
- MongoDB NoSQL database
- Mongoose ODM for data modeling
- Indexed collections for performance
- Secure data access patterns

### Communication Flow
1. Client requests are handled by React Router
2. API calls are made to Express endpoints
3. Express middleware processes requests
4. Database operations are performed via Mongoose
5. Responses are returned through the API
6. React components update the UI

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Backend Structure
The API follows a feature-based modular architecture:

**Configuration Layer**
- Environment configuration
- Database connection settings
- Security configurations
- CORS and middleware setup

**Feature Modules**
- User management system
- Authentication services
- Role-based access control
- Profile management

**Middleware Layer**
- Authentication middleware
- Error handling middleware
- Input validation middleware
- Rate limiting middleware

**Utility Layer**
- Database connection utilities
- Token generation and verification
- Input validation helpers
- Error handling utilities

### Frontend Structure
The React application follows a component-based architecture:

**Component Hierarchy**
- Layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation)
- Page components (Home, Dashboard, Profile)
- Feature components (UserCard, ProjectCard)
- UI components (Button, Input, Modal)

**State Management**
- Redux store configuration
- User state management
- Application state management
- Async action handling

**Service Layer**
- API service functions
- Authentication services
- Data transformation utilities
- Error handling services

## üîå API Documentation

### Authentication Endpoints
The API provides comprehensive authentication services including user registration, login, logout, and token management. All authentication endpoints use JWT tokens for secure communication.

### User Management Endpoints
Complete CRUD operations for user management with role-based access control. Admin users can manage all users while regular users can only manage their own profiles.

### Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Security headers with Helmet

### Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent JSON format with success status, message, and data fields. Error responses include detailed error information for debugging.

## üé® Frontend Architecture

### Component Architecture
The frontend uses a hierarchical component structure with reusable components, page components, and layout components. Each component follows React best practices with proper prop validation and state management.

### State Management
Redux Toolkit manages application state with slices for different features. The store configuration includes middleware for async operations and development tools for debugging.

### Routing Strategy
React Router handles client-side routing with protected routes for authenticated users and role-based route access. The routing configuration supports nested routes and dynamic parameters.

### Styling Approach
Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling with custom components and responsive design. The styling system supports dark mode, custom themes, and component-specific styles.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

### User Collection Schema
The user collection stores comprehensive user information including authentication details, profile information, and account status. The schema includes proper indexing for performance and data validation.

### Data Relationships
The database design supports user roles, profile management, and activity tracking. Relationships are maintained through references and embedded documents as appropriate.

### Indexing Strategy
Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields ensures optimal database performance. Indexes are created on user email, role, and status fields for efficient queries.

### Data Validation
Mongoose schemas include comprehensive validation rules for data integrity. Custom validation functions ensure business logic compliance and data quality.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Authentication Security
- JWT token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Account lockout mechanism after failed login attempts
- Session management with automatic token refresh

### Authorization System
- Role-based access control with user and admin roles
- Route-level protection with middleware
- API endpoint authorization based on user roles
- Resource-level access control

### Input Security
- Comprehensive input validation using express-validator
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- CSRF protection through secure tokens

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Security headers with Helmet middleware
- Request size limiting and validation
